- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ryanshacklett
I have small coding experience before this class. I have some basic information.
I am taking this class because I am generally interested in coding and want to learn more about it.
I play soccer and basketball both through school.
I want to become a better coder with gaining some good information.
